# Road Map

  1- Use of SQLite in Memory database as Project file.
  2- Use of Windows Registry to save the last projects, some options and 
     the list of the las projects to reopen them.
  3- Improve User Interface. 
  4- Use of OpenAI IA connection for things like GetSingular Names for
     the entities and convert to Camel Style (pascal) the names of the fields.
